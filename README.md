# LinkedList
CS concepts showing the implementation of LinkedList in javascript. The linked list here is set up as a Doubly Linked List.

A Linked Lists is a series of nodes where one node is linked directly to the nextnode and so on. In this example I have set up a doubly linked list. In the is case the node are linked to both the next node and the previous node.

In both cases for singly linked list and doubly linked list the Big O is O(n). Since the Big O for both `singly` and `doubly linked list` are `O(n)` it's worth setting up a doubly linked list as it give you the extra option of linking back to the previous node.

The difference between a Linked List and an Array is that an array is index while a linked list is not. 

Advantages: Insert and Delete can be really quick.

Disadvantage:  Getting to the nth node is slow.
